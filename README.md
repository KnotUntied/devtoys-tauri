Shamelessly derived from [DevToys](https://devtoys.app/) by Etienne Baudoux.

Work in progress.

## Todo

- More tools (may or may not be in parity with DevToys)
- License and view for third-party licenses
- Proper overscroll behavior
- App icon
- Automated testing
- Make router use data instead of hardcoding routes
- Monaco editor settings
- Switch from localStragoe and navigator clipboard to Tauri-provided solutions?
- Name?
